    <h1>Hello and welcome to my website!</h1>
    <h2>This website is made using basic HTML</h2>
    <p>However, just HTML is like having a skeleton without anything on top of it</p>
    <h3>This is where CSS comes in to help style your website</h3>
    <p>I can't wait to start learning CSS to spice things up!</p>
